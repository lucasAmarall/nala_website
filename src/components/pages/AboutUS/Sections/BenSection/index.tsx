        Although he has a degree in Computer Science & Data Econometrics from
        M.I.T., Gulakâ€™s passion has always been art. Over the years, he has been
        a painter, collector & agent, giving him a multi-faceted vantage point
        on the industry. Inspired by seeing talented artists unable to break
        into the global market, Gulak built NALA to help open the market to all
        artists.
